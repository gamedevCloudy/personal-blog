**Context:**
- Saw a post on [r/developersindia](reddit.com/r/developersindia) that explained that the shallow ed tech courses won't get you deep experience. This post was going to be a comment but as it lengthened I felt the need to turn it into a full post.
- 2025 AI/DS grad
- Current working at a startup at 8lpa as "AI Engineer"
- I tried to post this thice but kept violating rule 1 for some reason, so here's a blog post. 

## Learning Exprience

1. College curriculum avoids depth. It gives you high level overview of things, mostly theory. We did have GPU enabled lab, where we'd train nureal nets on various tasks (mostly vision). If one would actually write the code required, they'll learn. It was mostly one architecture or type of model per exp.

2. GPU programming: I get that one's expirence can be from GPU programming, but someone learning "AI" shouldn't be learning CUDA programming -- unless they want to do it explicitly. Albeit, when working at say tier one or frontier labs you'll need to understand how to run training or inference on massivly parallel dist. systems. I've seen handful of people on twitter like [maharshi](https://x.com/mrsiipa) who got a job for optimizing kernels and working close to GPUs. 

3. I mostly started in summer break after 3rd year. I did 3 things:
   1. Stanford CS229 (mainly to get deeper knowledge of ML Stats, Prob & DM (I had learnt this quite well in 3rd year itself - some if it is pre-requisite)
   2. Practical Deep Learning For Coders: (a prereq if you join Tesla) It dives into great depth in deep learning on training and configuring models for all kinds of tasks with use of fastai lib, but also teaches you on how to build it from scratch.
   3. Deep Learning Cert from deeplearningai: this I had to speedrun since it was a cert I had to submit to college (MOOC), but I knew many foundations from the prev course so I was able to solve the exercises.

4. I was quite insecure at this time since I needed some cashflow so I texted the founder of my current startup if they had anything I can help them with (it used to deal with AR/VR - I had an unpaid internship that lasted a year or so, so it was relevant to what it was doing then). Given my deg and cert I was able to secure a role for AI Engg Intern.
   - It was a small team, 3 ppl incl founder.
   - I didn't know anything about AI agents and chatbots - which is what 90% of the crowd associates "AI" with.
   - for the first two months I as in "run and gun" developing projects as I go with langchain and stuff.
   - I was able to build agentic systems with primitive chains (langgraph/graph based agentic system didin't exsist then).
   - Skill issues: I sucked at getting good responses until around 4 months.
   - later on I picked up quite a few things as we went: I did projects with **Cashe, BoAt, Dabur, Vi** and a few other brands.
   - All these were genai projects.

5. (fastai) allowed me to get an research internship around 7th sem that deals with AI safety in image generation models.

## Getting a job

Around last 4 months of college felt that I may or may not be retained, since there was no formal talk ongoing and I wanted to try my shot at higher paying jobs if I can. I wanted to do something around "Research Engineering" role.
Although after 150+ applications (maybe overstating), I didn't get a job.

On Campus: As a safety net I applied and got selected for LTIMindtree (mass recruiting) for 4LPA. Which felt like a punch in the gut. Bcz I felt bad that is this all I get for the hardwork?

Around April, I was able to get interviews which went upto the 4th round. This was a role similar to what I had been doing. They liked a few things about me: depth of knowlege on these systems, creating one from scratch and all the other things I was able to pick up: fastapi, docker, self-hosting and GCP (basically backend stuff). Only conflicting thing was that I had continued at my old place for quite a long time (10 months), they felt maybe I won't take the job and simply got ghosted around this round. And I had "too much responsiblity". 5th final was supposed to with the tech lead, but never came around that.

During this time I had my final exams so I didn't push. I was able to get full time offer a month after the exams ended. I feel 8LPA is a bit low for the desired pay relative to my skill level.

## Current
- Job requires me to move to BLR.
- this is the reason pay feels lower.
- I've shipped 2 SaaS products, atleast a handful internal tools - focusing on content, media and automations, atleast a handful of B2B projects. The team is now 7.
- lack of specialization: the company is taking a b2b service stance, which would mean that I will not be getting specialization
- scale: my code has touched over 3k people at present, which just feels insane.

## Predictions
- Current role lacks depth, it is enjoyable, but still doesn't challenge me enough on intellectual level and can be irritating. lack of depth would mean this woudn't be high paying in the future.
- Stronger Foundations: taking a class on Advanced NLP will get one a higher yield than building autonomus agents.

## What I plan to do
- DSA: She's like a clingy ex, I don't want her in my life, I haven't spent a long time with her, but maybe I need her now. I don't like her, but she's needed. And she's the only one available. Idk what this metaphor is, make sense of it urself.
- Systems Design post that.
- I may switch to some FAANG job, since it seems easier, relaxes - everyone should like high pay (morally attained ofc).
- Specialize in one vertical in AI, probably "interpretablity" as it seems very intresting to me.
- I may post for a resume review here soon.

This is still a broad plan that may not lead anywhere. But I'm affirmative of my skills. I just wanna say that I am in a less "worrysome" state than I was at the start of this year.

ty for the read.
