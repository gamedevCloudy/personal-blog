## Moments over pixels

One should buy a budget camera + a cheaper phone than a flagship phone.

MKBHD says, "What is a photo?". We've come so far in computational photography that computed photos are indistinguishable from real ones. I recently tried Google's 'Add Me', and it's really believable.

In general, I do not like the ease of photos. How we feel every moment needs to be captured and why we need only the top x phone to get the best moments possible.

We should be more in the moment. How we're glued to our phones is sad. These snaps end up being forgotten. And you lost the touch you could have had with the moment. Somehow, we have trained our brains to enjoy 'shareable moments' more than whatever hits our neurons naturally.

It's become a game: send more snaps and be rewarded in the online circle. We don't meet more 'real' people. We don't share a physical bond.

We should be sharing whatever we experience with whoever was present when taking the snap. Simply, not taking the snap.

It's fine when you're alone and find something too cute/fun to not share with one person.

But next time you pull your phone out to take a pic, maybe smile at what you saw and put it back in.
