## Bluesky a fresh breath

Bluesky has been a new emergence as twitter alternatives. Although, from the get go I wansn't very attracted to Twitter. The UI is too populated and everyone's shouting.

Bluesky seems quiter, not many people.

Although, its counter-intuitive - I get less eyes on my work. Even so, I prefer it for the same reason. I wanna be seen but not too much.

### Why BSky?

Its been about 25 days since I started posting there. I am able to talk anything, not many will see it, nor it would be judged.
But, my orignal intent was increase reach on my reserach interests and possibly land a job via networking and public learning.
That hasn't been going so well. I just post about what happend throughout my day. And one thing that I did related to coding.
I need to follow a structured approach to this.

### Present state

Workload is often heavy these days, I barely get to learn new things (in terms of picking up texbooks and learning hard skills). I just wanna dedicate myself to Deep Learning and develop an understanding of interpretability in AI. That to me seems like a place I would want to be in. Although, this has rarely worked out in my favour. I never end up doing something consisent enough to develop good skills. My goal is to get into resreach engineering - would love to get into Anthropic.

My actions are lack luster. They are barely there. The paper I printed, lie here on my stash eating dirt. I only read 2-3 smaller ones and mostly stopped there. Gym was one thing I did consistently that too has stopped. I can feel my nerves pumping through my head as the stress of not getting a job is building up. And I feel bad all this time -- knowing all the things I can do but never do them.

### So what now?

I honestly don't know, may start a ghost account that hides my face and identity on X. And post daily on one thing that I did for the day. Probably, that's good for reach.

And some automations to follow top people at Reasearch firms.
Also, my resume is so off rn, I do product stuff - barely any research is there. I can barely keep up with one thing though, its hard to build this way.
