<meta name="description" content="Bluesky has been a new emergence as twitter alternatives. Although, from the get go I wansn&rsquo;t very attracted to Twitter. The UI is too populated and everyone&rsquo;s shouting.
Bluesky seems quiter, not many people.
Although, its counter-intuitive - I get less eyes on my work. Even so, I prefer it for the same reason. I wanna be seen but not too much.
Why BSky?
Its been about 25 days since I started posting there. I am able to talk anything, not many will see it, nor it would be judged.
But, my orignal intent was increase reach on my reserach interests and possibly land a job via networking and public learning.
That hasn&rsquo;t been going so well. I just post about what happend throughout my day. And one thing that I did related to coding.
I need to follow a structured approach to this." />

<h3 id="why-bsky">Why BSky?</h3>
<p>Its been about 25 days since I started posting there. I am able to talk anything, not many will see it, nor it would be judged.
But, my orignal intent was increase reach on my reserach interests and possibly land a job via networking and public learning.
That hasn&rsquo;t been going so well. I just post about what happend throughout my day. And one thing that I did related to coding.
I need to follow a structured approach to this.</p>
<h3 id="present-state">Present state</h3>
<p>Workload is often heavy these days, I barely get to learn new things (in terms of picking up texbooks and learning hard skills). I just wanna dedicate myself to Deep Learning and develop an understanding of interpretability in AI. That to me seems like a place I would want to be in. Although, this has rarely worked out in my favour. I never end up doing something consisent enough to develop good skills. My goal is to get into resreach engineering - would love to get into Anthropic.</p>
<p>My actions are lack luster. They are barely there. The paper I printed, lie here on my stash eating dirt. I only read 2-3 smaller ones and mostly stopped there. Gym was one thing I did consistently that too has stopped. I can feel my nerves pumping through my head as the stress of not getting a job is building up. And I feel bad all this time &ndash; knowing all the things I can do but never do them.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-now">So what now?</h3>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know, may start a ghost account that hides my face and identity on X. And post daily on one thing that I did for the day. Probably, that&rsquo;s good for reach.</p>
<p>And some automations to follow top people at Reasearch firms.
Also, my resume is so off rn, I do product stuff - barely any research is there. I can barely keep up with one thing though, its hard to build this way.</p>
