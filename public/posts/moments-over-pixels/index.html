These snaps end up being forgotten. And you lost the touch you could have had with the moment. Somehow, we have trained our brains to enjoy &lsquo;shareable moments&rsquo; more than whatever hits our neurons naturally.</p><p>It&rsquo;s become a game: send more snaps and be rewarded in the online circle. We don&rsquo;t meet more &lsquo;real&rsquo; people. We don&rsquo;t share a physical bond.</p><p>We should be sharing whatever we experience with whoever was present when taking the snap. Simply, not taking the snap.</p><p>It&rsquo;s fine when you&rsquo;re alone and find something too cute/fun to not share with one person.</p><p>But next time you pull your phone out to take a pic, maybe smile at what you saw and put it back in.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
